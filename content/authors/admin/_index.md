Hi! I'm Alizée, a PhD student in Machine Learning and a fellow at the {{< staticref "https://ai.ethz.ch/about-us/people/alizee-pace.html" "newtab" >}}ETH AI Center{{< /staticref >}} in Zürich. I am lucky to work with {{< staticref "https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/people/person/alizee-pace" "newtab" >}}Prof. Gunnar Rätsch{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "http://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf{{< /staticref >}}. I am also part of the {{< staticref "https://ellis.eu/projects/policy-learning-for-clinical-decision-support" "newtab" >}}ELLIS{{< /staticref >}} PhD program. My main research goal is to develop ML solutions for clinical decision support and personalised treatment recommendation, with an interest for offline reinforcement learning, representation learning and causal inference.

I am an incoming student researcher at Google Zürich, working with {{< staticref "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EoVDI3MAAAAJ&hl=en" "newtab" >}}Aliaksei Severyn{{< /staticref >}} on RL methods to improve LLM training.

Before my PhD, I led a project on imitation learning for clinical decision-making with {{< staticref "https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar{{< /staticref >}} at the University of Cambridge. My professional experience also includes medical device development and software engineering at CERN. I studied Physics, Materials Science and Machine Learning at Cambridge, where I consistently ranked first in my year.
