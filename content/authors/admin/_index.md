Hi! I'm Alizée, a PhD student in Machine Learning and a fellow at the {{< staticref "https://ai.ethz.ch/about-us/people/alizee-pace.html" "newtab" >}}ETH AI Center{{< /staticref >}} in Zürich. I am lucky to work with {{< staticref "https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/people/person/alizee-pace" "newtab" >}}Prof. Gunnar Rätsch{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "http://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf{{< /staticref >}}. I am also part of the {{< staticref "https://ellis.eu/projects/policy-learning-for-clinical-decision-support" "newtab" >}}ELLIS{{< /staticref >}} PhD program. My main research goal is to develop ML solutions for decision support and treatment recommendation systems, with an interest for offline reinforcement learning, representation learning and causal inference.

In 2023, I was a student researcher at Google Zürich, developing new methods in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with {{< staticref "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EoVDI3MAAAAJ&hl=en" "newtab" >}}Aliaksei Severyn{{< /staticref >}} and the wider {{< staticref "https://bard.google.com/chat" "newtab" >}}Bard{{< /staticref >}} team.

Before my PhD, I led a project on imitation learning for clinical decision-making with {{< staticref "https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar{{< /staticref >}} at the University of Cambridge. My professional experience also includes medical device development and software engineering at CERN. I studied Physics, Materials Science and Machine Learning at Cambridge, where I consistently ranked first in my year.
